Workout Mixer Android Application created for AppJam 2016.

The purpose of the app is to scan devices for music and given a required length of time, to create a playlist matching the time limit. This allows the user's music to be used as a timer for numerous activities such as: studying, working out, indicating when you need to leave for something or as a timer when you want your music to turn off as you fall asleep.
